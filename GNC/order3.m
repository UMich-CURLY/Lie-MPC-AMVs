% Path generation using cubic polynominals. To be used with demowpt.mdl
%
% This version uses the cubic spline method to create a third-order polynomial going through 
% all the waypoints. All calculations are made offline, and the coeficcients are returned in
% table-form. The variable is theta, and it is increased with one between each waypoint.
%
% Example call: [table, pathlength] = order3([0 200 400 700 1000],[0 600 500 400 1200],1,1,0,0,0,0)
