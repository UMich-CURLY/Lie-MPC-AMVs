% Path generation using 5th order polynominals. To be used with demowpt.mdl
%
% This version uses a fifth-order polynomial and makes the second
% derivatives in each waypoint start and end in zero. The calculations are
% done offline, and the coeficcients are returned in table-form. 
%
% Example call: [table, pathlength] = order5(1, 0, [0 200 400 700 1000],[0 600 500 400 1200])
