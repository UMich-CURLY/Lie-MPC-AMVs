\title{\casadi{} vs. \mpctools{}}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

Below, we present an example file to show how much code is saved by using \mpctools{}.
On the left side, we show the the script written using the pure \casadi{} module, while on the right, we show the script rewritten to use \mpctools{}.

\hspace{1em}

\input{casadivsmtc.tex}

Even for this simple example, \mpctools{} can save a significant amount of coding, and it makes script files much shorter and more readable while still taking advantage of the computational power provided by \casadi{}.
